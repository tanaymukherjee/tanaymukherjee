### Welcome to the world of Tanay!

I like to introduce myself as a Statistician and a Data Science Enthusiast with 6 years of experience in analytics domain executing data-driven solutions to increase efficiency, and accuracy in data processing with strong programming expertise. I am experienced at creating regression models, using predictive modeling, and deciphering data mining algorithms to deliver insights and implement action-oriented solutions to complex business problems. 

Iâ€™ve built my career in a variety of roles and industries, mostly around Analytics and Data Science and have worked with Fortune 500 companies like IBM, Ogilvy (WPP Group), Maersk, and Tesla. I have worked with clients from across the globe and had a wonderful time learning about different cultures.

I am comfortable with R and Python and can use it to solve various problems starting from data wrangling, modeling, automation, etc. I have built multiple projects on ML libraries and my work is accessible via GitHub repositories here. I am pretty confident with SQL in terms of fetching data and doing necessary operations to ensure we have clean and filtered data for processing. Also, have good experience with data visualization tools like [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/tanay.mukherjee#!/) and Google Data Studio.

I have a decent understanding of big data and have worked on AWS wherein I configured and established connections all by myself for multitude of available cloud services. I have worked with EMR, EC2, S3, Athena, Kinesis. I am familiar with Hadoop ecosystem and I am regularly building more on this part to acquire knowledge by implementing projects.

During free time, I like to read or listen to music. Watching sports is my best way to relax - be it cricket, tennis or soccer, I am in for all. Last read this book called - Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky. If you haven't read it yet, then please do at the first chance.
